## Professional Summary

Frontend developer with continuously gaining backend knowledge. My creativity comes
from my **video-making past**, which followed me through my first project as a **frontend
developer**. 

After my first project, I worked both **frontend and backend** as well to this day.
Through the years I started to learn new technologies such as Vue.js, and its ecosystem,
MongoDB, and Node.js. I would like to ***pursue*** a carrier in frontend development with a
***modern*** JavaScript framework, or in backend development.
